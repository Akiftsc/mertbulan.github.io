I live in Hamburg, Germany and work as Software Developer at [Shopify](http://shopify.com). I work with technologies like Ruby, Ruby on Rails, TypeScript and React Native. I consider myself as Product-Minded Developer. Previously, I worked at [XING](http://xing.com), the biggest professional network in Germany.

I like reading books ([my Goodread account](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38416033-mert)), riding my bike, learning new things, being in nature instead of crowded places, blogging, podcasting, cooking, playing video games and creating products that people love.

I am pragmatist, generalist and minimalist. I am interested in Stoicism and I am trying to live environmentally friendly as much as I can. Nowadays, I am into 3D Printing.

I am hosting a Turkish podcast called [Farklı Düşün](https://podcasts.apple.com/tr/podcast/id1572640234) (Think Different). In the podcast, with my co-host [Seyfeddin](https://seyfedd.in), we talk about Apple, technology, privacy and books. The podcast is in Top 5 under Technology category on Apple Podcast Turkey.
