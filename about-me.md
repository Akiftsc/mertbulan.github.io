I graduated in 2018 with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from Dokuz Eylul University in Izmir, Turkey. I live in Hamburg, Germany and work as Software Engineer at XING.

I am a pragmatic and minimalist person. I like reading, riding my bike and learning new things. Nowadays, I am interested in Stoicism. I like being in nature instead of crowded places.

I like creating products that people love.

I am trying to live environmentally friendly. I am vegan, I use renewable energy at home, I commute by bike and I seperate my trashes for recycling. I don't buy products if I don't really need.
