I graduated in 2018 with a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from Dokuz Eylul University in Izmir, Turkey.

I live in Hamburg, Germany and work as Software Engineer at XING.

I like reading, riding my bike, learning new things, being in nature instead of crowded places, creating products that people love.

I am a pragmatic and minimalist person. Nowadays, I am interested in Stoicism.

I am trying to live environmentally friendly.
