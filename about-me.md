I live in Hamburg, Germany and work as Software Developer at Shopify. Previously, I worked at XING.

I like reading, riding my bike, learning new things, being in nature instead of crowded places, blogging, podcasting, cooking, playing video games and creating products that people love. 


I am pragmatist, generalist and minimalist. I am interested in Stoicism. I am trying to live environmentally friendly.
