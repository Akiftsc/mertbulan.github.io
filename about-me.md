I live in Hamburg, Germany, and work as Software Developer at [Shopify](http://shopify.com). I work with technologies like Ruby, Ruby on Rails, TypeScript, and React Native. I consider myself a Product-Minded Developer. Previously, I worked at [XING](http://xing.com), the biggest professional network in Germany.

I like reading books ([Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38416033-mert)), riding my bike, learning new things, being in nature instead of crowded places, blogging, podcasting, cooking, playing video games, and creating products that people love.

I am pragmatist, generalist and minimalist. I am interested in Stoicism and I am trying to live environmentally friendly as much as I can. Nowadays, I am into 3D Printing and photography.

I am hosting a Turkish podcast called [Farklı Düşün](https://podcasts.apple.com/tr/podcast/id1572640234) (Think Different). In the podcast, with my co-host [Seyfeddin](https://seyfedd.in), we talk about Apple, technology, privacy, and books. The podcast is in the Top 5 under the Technology category on Apple Podcast Turkey.

### What is this WXX.log series?

I do a lot of things every week and I thought that instead of writing a blog post about those things, I can write a weekly log that just shortly mentions the highlights of the week. Maybe I started to watch a new TV series or finished reading a book, or read an article that I found very interesting. In this series, I am going to share them with just a few sentences so I am not going to spend hours thinking about how I can write a blog post about them. I hope you enjoy it! 

Let me know what you are thinking about this series by sending an email to me.
