I graduated in 2018 with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from Dokuz Eylul University in İzmir, Turkey. (I was in 2nd place and earned high honor degree) I have been living in Hamburg, Germany and working as Software Engineer at XING.

I am a pragmatic and minimalist person. I like reading (mostly non-fiction books), riding my bike and learning new things. Nowadays, I am interested in Stoicism philosophy. I like being in nature instead of crowded places.

I use mostly Ruby/Rails and JavaScript/React while working. I am also interested in mobile app developement and Swift/SwiftUI. I am planning to learn Arduino and 3D printing.

I like creating products that people love.

I am trying to live environment friendly. I am vegan, I use renewable energy at home, I commute by bike and I seperate my trashes for recycling. I don't buy products if I don't really need.
