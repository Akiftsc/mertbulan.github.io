### Developer Hegemony

Recently I finished reading a book called [Developer Hegemony](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35051753-developer-hegemony). It was an interesting read. It brings a different perspective to the work of developers. Right now, most of the developers work like all the other white-collar workers but since we control of means of production, we can have a much better working life if we pick a path into efficienciers. 

In the book, the author defines a developer as not someone who creates web pages or apps but someone who makes things more efficient and help business to save money. When you look at your job from this perspective, you realize that you don't need to work a 9-to-5 job for 5 days a week and you can stop working as a big company's cost center and become an efficiencier. There are a lot of good suggestions in the book about how to become an efficiencier and what to do first. (Spoiler: start a blog!) If you are a developer and tired of boring corporate life, it is a nice read.


### Halo Infinite

I have never played the Halo series before but I heard many times. Last week, Microsoft released the free-to-play version of Halo, [Halo Infinite](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1240440/Halo_Infinite/) and I started to play with my friend on the same day. I can easily say that it is a nice game to play. It is a little bit hard to master quickly but once you learn the game, it is really fun to play. Compared to all the other FPS games, it has little bit different dynamics but you will used to them quickly. I will probably play it regularly.
