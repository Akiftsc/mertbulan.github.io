### Project Hail Mary

I met Andy Weir with his book, [The Martian](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18007564-the-martian). I remember how an exciting story it was. If I remember correctly, I finished that book in a few days. Then, I watched the movie of the same book but I didn't like the movie as much as I liked the book. 

After a few years, Andy Weir released his second book, [Artemis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34928122-artemis). That book was also good but not as good as The Martian. It was an interesting story on a moon base.

When I saw his third book, [Project Hail Mary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54493401-project-hail-mary) and after reading the reviews, I got excited. When I started to read the book, I felt the same thing that I felt while reading The Martian. You can't just put the book down, you just keep reading because you want to know what is going to happen next. The book is about a high school science teacher that will become an astronaut and he has one mission: saving the planet earth. This time the story takes place in empty space.

The book does not only satisfy your sci-fi desires, but it also makes you laugh.
